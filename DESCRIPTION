Description: The package allows the usage of OpenRouteService to calculate the
    (shortest) routing distances of large datasets to certain points of
    interest. It also provides functions to download or calculate nearby points
    of interest. To process larger datasets, the package relies on a local
    Docker setup of the OpenRouteService backend. The package facilitates the
    setup by including a class that acts as a setup wizard and control panel.
