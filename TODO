TO DO:
- Get more test coverage
- Try out pkgdown
- Implement ORS host customization
- Root out previous mistakes
- Try out callr for docker start notify_when_ready? (What are the advantages?)
- Implement GitLab CI/CD for linux runners
- Fix summary print method
- Reconsider `verify_crs` (Is it needed after all?)

DONE:
- Add a way to change the container/image name? (Useful for tests)
- Try out GitLab CI/CD
- Write package usage vignette
- Reduce hard imports (either entirely or make them suggests) -> removed dplyr, tidyr, purrr, magrittr and fields
- Fix case of multiple ORS warnings in one response json -> overhauled entire handling system
- Improve conditions printing by implementing console width dependent line breaks -> added a strwrap call

DROPPED:
- Try out docker pulling ORS instead of git cloning -> doesn't make any sense
- Find ways to increase performance of get_route_lengths -> most time and resources are spent by ORS
- Find ways to properly catch command line progress bars -> not possible
- Implement a custom print method for ORS R6 classes? -> why?
